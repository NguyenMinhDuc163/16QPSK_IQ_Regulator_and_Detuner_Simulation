# Wireless-Communication-Exam

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to estimate and correct the IQ imbalance in a QPSK modulation using Simulink and Matlab. Both amplitude and phase imbalance can occur as shown in the figure below.

The Simulink model to view the saved signals was taken from the example [QPSK Transmitter and Receiver in Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/qpsk-transmitter-and-receiver-in-simulink.html) and is illustrated in figure below. The files are previously saved as 801 frames consisting of 12500 samples.

## The code

* Simulink model [NO_USRP.slx](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/No_USRP.slxc) allows to view the saved signals with imbalance
  * signal_1: unbalanced signal
  * signal_2: unbalanced signal with higher power than signal_1
  * signal_IQ10: signal with 10% imbalance in transmission
  * signal_IQ20: signal with 20% imbalance in transmission
  * signal_IQ30: signal with 30% imbalance in transmission.

* The function [delete_first_zeroes.m]() deletes the first zeroes from a signal 
* The function [apply_IQ_imbal.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/apply_IQ_imbal.m) applies an IQ imbalance to a signal
* The function [imbalance_algorithm_estimation.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/imbalance_algorithm_estimation.m) estimates the imbalance from a signal
* The function [imbalance_correction.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/imbalance_correction.m) corrects the imbalance of a signal 
* The function [imbalance_estimation.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/imbalance_estimation.m) estimates the amplitude and phase imbalance from a signal using comm.IQImbalanceCompensator

## How to run
Open Matlab and run [main.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/main.m).

The input signals are not available due to the large dimensions. The input signals signal_1, signal_2, signal_IQ10, signal_IQ20, signal_IQ30 are 801x12500 matrices (801 frames x 12500 samples).

The output of [imbalance_estimation.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/imbalance_estimation.m) is very similar to the expected values, in fact for the signal modified by [apply_IQ_imbal.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/apply_IQ_imbal.m), an amplitude imbalance of 2.4623 dB is estimated, while the expected one is 20 log_10 (1.3) = 2.2789 dB.

The results of [imbalance_algorithm_estimation.m](https://github.com/MatteoOrlandini/Wireless-Communication-Exam/blob/main/imbalance_algorithm_estimation.m) are listed in the following table.

|    Signal   | Imbalance [dB] | Estimated imbalance [dB] |
|:-----------:|----------------|--------------------------|
| Signal_IQ10 | 0.82785        | 0.81093                  |
| Signal_IQ20 | 1.5836         | 1.2474                   |
| Signal_IQ30 | 2.2789         | 1.6251                   |

## Conclusions

This project showed, through the Matlab script, how it is possible to apply
and correct the IQ imbalance and how to estimate the imbalance from a signal
unknown. This estimate is best for a software unbalanced signal
compared to an imbalanced signal acquired by a transmitter.
This error is due to the recovery of the receiving carrier and ambiguity
phase.

The errors that arise due to
a phase and frequency error are shown respectively in the figures below.
